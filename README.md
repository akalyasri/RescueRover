# RescueRover

Every year there are about 500,000 detectable earthquakes. About 100,000 of those can be felt, and about 100 of them can cause damage. So, every time an earthquake causes damage it hurts about thousands to millions of people, it just depends on the earthquakeâ€™s magnitude. During earthquakes, heavy objects fall on top of people and animals and they get trapped, without food or water for days. Also, if they get found it takes a lot of time to pick up a heavy bolder or such.
My idea to solve this problem is to build the Rescue Rover, which can go into small cracks and lift up objects just enough for the human or animal to get to safety.
The Rescue Rover is an Arduino-based, remote-controlled rover with an automatic scissor jack. The rover is also equipped with lights so it can work during the dark.
